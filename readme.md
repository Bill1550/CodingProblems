# A project with some coding problems
The problems can be found in the unit tests.



## Interactive Kotlin

Interactive Kotlin can be used in Android Studio by creating a Kotlin scratch file.

*NOTE:* The new menu in AS includes a "Kotlin Worksheet" option. This doesn't seem to work correctly
in current versions (Dolphin, Electric Eel) of AS.

To create a usable Kotlin worksheet, use the menu path:

File -> New -> Scratch File -> Kotlin

(don't selected Kotlin/Native def)

Once the file is open, at the top from the combo box labeled: Use Class Path of Module,
select the app main or test module. This will give the worksheet access to all the 
configured dependencies as well as classes created in that project.

Change the project window to display "Project" rather than "Android" can make finding the created scratch file much easier.
